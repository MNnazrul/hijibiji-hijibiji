A **complete advanced project** that showcases:

✅ **Blockchain development** (smart contracts, transactions, etc.)
✅ **Backend development** (Node.js: API, security, integration)
✅ **Frontend development** (Next.js: UI, wallet, web3 interactions)

## 🎯 Project Title:

# **CertiChain** — Blockchain-Based Certificate Issuance & Verification System

---

## 🔥 What It Does

An advanced **Web3-enabled app** for organizations (e.g., universities, bootcamps) to **issue tamper-proof digital certificates** on the blockchain.

* 🧑‍🏫 Organizations issue certificates
* 🧑‍🎓 Users can verify their certificate's authenticity
* 🔗 Every certificate is stored on-chain with a public hash
* 📄 Metadata stored on IPFS (name, title, issuer, date)
* ✅ Zero possibility of forgery

---

## 🧩 Core Features

### 👥 Auth System

* Backend handles organization & user accounts
* Admin dashboard for issuers (login, upload, track)
* JWT-based secure authentication

### 📝 Certificate Issuance

* Upload student info + document (PDF)
* Hash the file and store metadata to **IPFS**
* Issue a **smart contract transaction** with the hash + metadata
* Record transaction hash in database (backend)

### 🔍 Verification Portal

* Anyone can enter a certificate ID or hash
* App will:

  * Fetch IPFS metadata
  * Confirm blockchain validity (owner, signature, timestamp)
  * Show full cert details if verified ✅

### 📦 Storage

* IPFS (e.g. Web3.Storage or Pinata free tier) for PDF files + metadata

### 📈 Dashboard

* Admin can view issued certificates, revoke (via smart contract), re-issue

### 🧠 Optional Add-ons (for more points):

* NFT-style ownership of certificate
* QR code for public verification
* Multi-signature issuing (Dean + Dept Head)

| Layer              | Tech Choices                                                           |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend**       | Next.js 14 (App Router), Tailwind, Ethers.js, Wagmi + RainbowKit       |
| **Backend**        | Node.js (Express/NestJS), JWT, PostgreSQL or MongoDB                   |
| **Blockchain**     | Solidity smart contract on Ethereum (or testnets like Sepolia, Mumbai) |
| **Storage**        | IPFS via Web3.Storage / Pinata                                         |
| **Smart Contract** | `CertificateIssuer.sol` — issues & verifies certs                      |

## 🧠 How It Works (Step-by-Step)

1. **Issuer logs in** → uploads certificate (PDF) → adds student name, course, etc.
2. **Backend hashes file**, uploads to IPFS
3. Smart contract called to **store hash + metadata on-chain**
4. Transaction hash + cert data stored in backend DB
5. **User or recruiter** goes to `/verify` → enters certificate ID
6. System fetches:

   * Metadata from IPFS
   * Validity from smart contract (e.g., is it genuine, revoked?)
7. ✅ Certificate verified visually

---

## 🎁 Bonus Features (To Impress)

* NFT minting for certificate as ERC-721 token
* Multi-user org roles (issuer, verifier, revoker)
* Upload .CSV to issue batch certs
* Real-time transaction status feedback (ethers.js)
* Gasless transactions (via relayer or Biconomy SDK)

| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Blockchain**   | Smart contract design + deployment + reading/writing via web3     |
| **Backend**      | API development, auth, IPFS integration, DB modeling              |
| **Frontend**     | Secure forms, wallet connect, transaction UI, public verification |
| **Architecture** | Real-world separation of concerns + user roles + integration      |
