## 🚦 Intelligent Travel & Local Business Assistant

**Problem it solves:**
Travelers or locals often want **context-aware recommendations** (restaurants, hotels, ATMs, bus stops, etc.) around their current or planned location, with real-time guidance, trip planning, and conversational interaction.

### 🔑 How Each Tech Fits In

1. **Google Maps API**

   * Provides geolocation, route planning, nearby place search.
   * Example: Find “vegetarian restaurants within 2km from my hotel” or “best route covering 3 tourist spots in Dhaka”.

2. **MCP Server (Model Context Protocol)**

   * Acts as the backend bridge between your AI agent (LangChain/LangGraph) and external services (Google Maps, your database, weather API, booking API).
   * Exposes structured tools (like `search_places`, `get_routes`, `get_weather`) to the AI.

3. **LangChain**

   * Handles RAG (retrieving city/travel guides from your own knowledge base).
   * Example: If the user asks “What is the best season to visit Sylhet?”, LangChain retrieves info from your custom documents.

4. **LangGraph**

   * Orchestrates **multi-step workflows** and tool use.
   * Example:

     * Step 1: Take user’s query → detect intent.
     * Step 2: Call Google Maps via MCP.
     * Step 3: Call RAG from LangChain.
     * Step 4: Combine results → respond conversationally.

### 🌍 Example Use Cases

* **“Plan me a one-day trip in Sylhet with top attractions and travel routes.”**
  → LangGraph orchestrates:
  → Calls LangChain for top attractions (from guide data).
  → Calls MCP→Google Maps to generate optimized travel routes.
  → Combines results into a daily plan.

* **“Show me the nearest halal restaurants to my hotel and rank them by Google reviews.”**
  → MCP server fetches places from Google Maps API.
  → LangChain organizes results, formats them nicely.
  → LangGraph ensures steps are executed in sequence.

* **“What is the weather near Jaflong tomorrow, and which tourist spots can I cover if it rains?”**
  → MCP: Weather API + Maps API.
  → LangChain: Suggests indoor attractions from knowledge base.
  → LangGraph merges everything.

### 🏗️ Architecture Overview

```
Frontend (React/Next.js or mobile app)
      |
      v
LangGraph (Agent Orchestration)
      |
      +--> LangChain (RAG: Travel guides, FAQs, documents)
      |
      +--> MCP Server
             |
             +--> Google Maps API
             +--> Weather API
             +--> Custom DB (e.g., hotels/discounts)
```

### 🚀 Why this is a good idea:

* **Real-world usefulness** → tourism, local business discovery, trip planning.
* **Demonstrates AI orchestration** → uses LangGraph to manage multiple tool calls.
* **Good portfolio project** → maps + AI agent + MCP server integration.
* **Extensible** → can add booking systems, ride-sharing, or payments later.
