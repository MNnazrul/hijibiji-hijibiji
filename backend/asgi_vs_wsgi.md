## üß† What are WSGI and ASGI?

Both are **"interfaces"** that connect your **Python web application** (like Django or FastAPI) to a **web server** (like Gunicorn or Uvicorn).

They define **how your app handles a request** from a browser.

| Term | Full Form                             |
| ---- | ------------------------------------- |
| WSGI | Web Server Gateway Interface          |
| ASGI | Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface |

---

## üê¢ WSGI ‚Äì Old but Simple (Synchronous)

### ‚úÖ Used in:

* **Flask**
* **Django (classic)**

### üß© How it works:

* **One request at a time** per worker
* Each request **waits** until it's done
* **Cannot handle WebSockets** or background jobs well

### üß† Think of it like:

> A single waiter in a restaurant. They take one customer, finish their order, and **only then** move to the next.

### üîß Example:

```python
def app(environ, start_response):
    start_response("200 OK", [("Content-Type", "text/plain")])
    return [b"Hello from WSGI"]
```

## ‚ö° ASGI ‚Äì Modern and Fast (Asynchronous)

### ‚úÖ Used in:

* **FastAPI**
* **Starlette**
* **Django (async version)**
* **WebSocket apps**

### üß© How it works:

* Uses **async/await**
* Can handle **many requests at the same time**
* Supports **WebSockets**, **long polling**, **real-time apps**

### üß† Think of it like:

> A smart restaurant with **multiple waiters**. While one is waiting for the food to be ready, they can serve other customers.

### üîß Example:

```python
async def app(scope, receive, send):
    await send({
        "type": "http.response.start",
        "status": 200,
        "headers": [(b"content-type", b"text/plain")]
    })
    await send({
        "type": "http.response.body",
        "body": b"Hello from ASGI"
    })
```

## üîÅ Side-by-Side Comparison

| Feature             | **WSGI**                         | **ASGI**                              |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Full Form           | Web Server Gateway Interface     | Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface |
| Request Handling    | **Synchronous (blocking)**       | **Asynchronous (non-blocking)**       |
| Concurrency         | One request per worker at a time | Many requests handled together        |
| WebSocket Support   | ‚ùå No                             | ‚úÖ Yes                                 |
| Real-Time Support   | ‚ùå Hard to implement              | ‚úÖ Built-in                            |
| Background Tasks    | ‚ùå Limited                        | ‚úÖ Easy with async functions           |
| Speed & Performance | üê¢ Slower under load             | ‚ö° Faster, especially with many users  |
| Used in             | Flask, Django (classic)          | FastAPI, Starlette, Django (modern)   |
| Server example      | Gunicorn (WSGI server)           | Uvicorn, Hypercorn (ASGI servers)     |

## üí° When to Use What?

| Situation                    | Choose                               |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Simple website / admin app   | WSGI (e.g., Django or Flask) is okay |
| Real-time app (chat, games)  | ASGI (e.g., FastAPI) is better       |
| High-concurrent APIs         | ASGI is more efficient               |
| Working with async libraries | ASGI (lets you use `async/await`)    |
| You need WebSockets          | ASGI is required                     |

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

* **WSGI**: Easy, good for simple apps, but **only handles one request at a time**. No WebSockets.
* **ASGI**: Modern, **handles many things at once**, works with **async**, and supports **real-time features** like chat, streaming, etc.
